Here is a list of countries offering citizenship by investment programs, sorted by investment amount and processing time. 

For personal reasons, I've included the total cost for the family of four (married couple with two underage children).

\* - Austria generally does not allow dual citizenship.

**Notes:**
- The investment amounts are generally the minimum required to qualify for citizenship.
- Processing times indicate the typical duration from application submission to citizenship approval.
- The total cost for a family assumes that the additional fees for a spouse and children are half of the main applicant's fees.
